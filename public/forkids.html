        <p>Our cycling club offers a unique motivation system for children who engage in cycling with our club. We call
          it "Pixels for Active Participation", and it allows children to earn rewards for their efforts in preparation
          and participation in competitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every time a child attends a training session, they receive a Pixel token. Additionally, if they perform well
          in competitions or participate in team-building events, they can earn extra Pixels. These tokens can be
          exchanged for various prizes, such as cycling accessories, t-shirts, plush toys, books, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, we offer additional opportunities to motivate children. For example, children who have earned a
          certain number of Pixels can receive an invitation to exclusive events, such as mountain biking, cycling
          tours, and bike trips.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also recognize the best cyclists in our club. Every year, we hold an awards ceremony where we recognize
          children who have achieved the greatest success in cycling. This can be either the best athlete, the one who
          has improved the most, the most active participant in training sessions, or the most active participant in
          social events.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our club, we not only help children develop their cycling skills, but also create a cycling community where
          children can feel like part of a team and receive motivation to develop their skills. Our Pixel Tokens for
          Active Participation system is one of the ways we help children achieve their best results and stay motivated
          throughout their training with our club.</p>
